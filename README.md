# Hello Open DIPS React App

Thanks for checking out our Hello World SMART on FHIR app that connects to our
DIPS sandbox, [Open DIPS](https://open.dips.no)! In short this application
showcases how you can build a SMART on FHIR app that works with DIPS Arena.
It's a patient-spoecific app which fetches some basic statistics on the patient,
e.g. their date of birth and a list of documents in the EHR.

# Build and run

To start the app, add your Open DIPS subscription key to `.env` and run 

```
npm install
npm start
```
